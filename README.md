# Shell-Intro

This is a renewed edition of _An Introduction To Linux Command Shell_ as a Markown/HTML formatted document.

This renewed edition has two goals. The first step will be the transformation into a Markown/HTML formatted document (for easier maintainability). 
The second step is to make the manual more attractive to users of non-Linux operating systems like Mac OS X or Android by removing redundant references to Linux.

Changes to the text are marked with `<ins>` and `<del>` which results in a representation of <ins>underlined</ins> and <del>strike-through</del> text respectively.
