# Shell-Intro

This is a renewed edition of _An Introduction To Linux Command Shell_ as a Markown/HTML formatted document.

This renewed edition has two goals. First, the translation into a Markown/HTML formatted document for easier maintainability. 
Second, to make the manual more attractive to users of non-Linux operating systems like Mac OS X or Android.
